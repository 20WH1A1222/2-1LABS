Experiment 5


Aim of the Experiment

Write a C++ program to use scope resolution operator. Display the various values ofthe same variables declared at different scope levels.
Step by Step Procedure of the Experiment

Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream.h, conio.h).

Step 2 - Create a class (circle) with the following members as public members. radius as data member. area() as member function.

Step 3 - Implement all the member functions with their respective code (Here, we have used scope resolution operator ::).

Step 4 - Initialize the num value to 100 outside the main class.

Step 5 - Create a main() method.

Step 6 - Create an object (c) of the above class inside the main() method.

Step 7 - Initialize the num value to 500 inside the main class.

Step 8 - Display num with scope resolution and without scope resolution to know the difference. ` Step 9 - Call the member function area().

Step 10 - returnn 0 to exit form the program execution.
