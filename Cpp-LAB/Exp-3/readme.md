Experiment 3


Aim of the Experiment


Write a C++ program to read the data of N employee and compute Net salary of each employee (DA=52% of Basic and Income Tax (IT) =30% of the gross salary)
Step by Step Procedure of the Experiment


Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream.h, conio.h).

Step 2 - Create a class Employee with the following members. EID, name, basic_salary, da, IT, gross_salary, and net_salary as data memebrs read(), net_sal(),gross_sal() and display() as member functions.

Step 3 - Implement all the member functions with their respective code.

Step 4 - Create a main() method.

Step 5 - Create an array of class object with a specific size and n as integer.

Step 6 - Read n(number of employees).

Step 7 - Call the read() method through the array of class object from 0 to n.

Step 8 - Call the net_sal() method through the array of class object from 0 to n.

Step 9 - Call the gross_sal() method through the array of class object from 0 to n.

Step 10 - Call the display() method through the array of class object from 0 to n.

Step 11 - returnn 0 to exit form the program execution.
