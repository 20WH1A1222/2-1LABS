Experiment 12c


Aim of the experiment

Write a C++ Program to illustrate concept of Virtual Functions
Step by Step procedure for the experiment:

Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream and string.h)

Step 2 - Create a base class (Base) with the following class members as public members. a as data members. display() and read() as member function by adding virtual keyword before member function.

Step 3 - Create a Derived class (Derived) with the following class members as public members. b as data members. display() and read() as member function.

Step 4 - Implement the member functions with the respective code.

Step 5 - Create a main() method.

Step 6 - Assign the address of class object (Base) to class pointer object (ptr).

Step 7 - Creating an object of Derived as obj.

Step 8 - Then, call the member functions read() and display() using class pointer object (ptr) to illustrate member functions access using class pointer.

Step 9 - Assign values to data members of the class using class pointer object to illustrate data members access using class pointer.

Step 10 - Finally, call the member functions initialize() and display() using class pointer object (ptr).

Step 11 - return 0 to exit form the program execution.
